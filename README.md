# Accessibility Code Refactor

This is a model of a website refactorization for optimizing accessibility. Accessibility is a vital aspect for consideration when designing web interfaces whether for public or simply commercial use. There is a wide range of possible disabilities to consider, so this project was primarily focused on code refactoring for use of semantic HTML elements, descriptive input for screen readers, and organization of flow.
